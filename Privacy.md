### 1.1 Personal Information and Analytic Data
SearchDeck is a privacy focused search engine; thus, we do not collect any marketing data or analytic data. By signing up for an account on SJAUTH, you agree to let us store a hashed and salted version of your password in our databases.
### 1.2 Cookies
Most web browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.

THE SITE’S COOKIES DO NOT AND CANNOT INFILTRATE A USER’S HARD DRIVE TO COLLECT ANY INFORMATION STORED ON THE HARD DRIVE.

## 2. External Services
SearchDeck uses a first-party service called SJAUTH to sync logins with other services. SJAUTH takes numerous measures to keep the passwords safe. The passwords are hashed using a sha256 hashing algorithm, as well as a salting method. We do not leak, share, or sell passwords.
