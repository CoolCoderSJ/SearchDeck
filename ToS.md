### 1.1 Description 
SearchDeck is a search engine that scrapes many websites to show you results all at once so that you never have to switch search engines again.
### 1.2 Third Party Services
To fit everyone's needs, we allow people to signup or login with an account to save preferences. The login system is fully managed by SJAUTH, and is used by many services. Your password is hashed, salted, and secured inside of a database, and is never sold or shared with anyone. Your account will never be used for any sort of marketing purposes, and will remain confidential.

## 2. Age Limits
